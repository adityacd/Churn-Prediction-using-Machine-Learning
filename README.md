# Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

### I have done this project for practicing my Machine learning understanding and concepts.
### Customer is will Churn or Loyal for a Company. 
### I used 3 ML Models for this project.

* [Logistic Regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-detailed-overview-46c4da4303bc)
* [Decision Tree Classifier](https://towardsdatascience.com/decision-tree-classification-de64fc4d5aac)
* [Random Forest Classifier](https://towardsdatascience.com/random-forest-classification-and-its-implementation-d5d840dbead0)



ML Model | Accuracy
------------ | -------------
Logistic Regression | 83.20%
Decision Tree Classifier| 83.60%
Random Forest Classifier | 82.80%
