### I have done this project for practicing my Machine learning understanding and concepts.
### Customer is will Churn or Loyal for a Company. 
### I used 3 ML Models for this project.

* [Logistic Regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-detailed-overview-46c4da4303bc)
* [Decision Tree Classifier](https://towardsdatascience.com/decision-tree-classification-de64fc4d5aac)
* [Random Forest Classifier](https://towardsdatascience.com/random-forest-classification-and-its-implementation-d5d840dbead0)

The Decision Tree Classifier has the better testing accuracy compared to the other models that I have used.

ML Model | Accuracy
------------ | -------------
Logistic Regression | 83.20%
Decision Tree Classifier| 83.60%
Random Forest Classifier | 82.80%

### *Conclusion : I kept the count of node in the Decision Tree Classifier as 3. I incresed the count beyond 3 and the model was converging towards overfitting. Accuracy more than 84%. It is ideal to keep the count of nodes to 3 for this model since the independent variables are not many.*
### *The same scenario occurs with Random Forest Classifier when I Increased the trees. Increasing trees results in overfitting.*
